# Hi there! 👋

## 🖥️ About Me
I'm Boran(/bo-run/) Şeref, a Software Engineer with a decade of proven experience, including the last 5 years dedicated to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and Senior SRE roles. My focus is on supporting large-scale software systems, streamlining processes, and driving automation and configuration management. I love hacking on coding projects, distributed computing, and diving deep into the Linux kernel.
